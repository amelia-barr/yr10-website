    This is Marley, he is a 10 year old Ragdoll. 
    Marley is short tempered with a very grumpy face, but really if he likes you he is the 
    sweetest boy you will ever meet, his favorite person in the world is my Dad, he snuggles 
    with him and sleeps with him all the time and when hes not around Marley is sad.

    This is Layla, she is a 9 year old Ragdoll, we got her around a year after we got Marley, 
    she has a very calm and lazy temperment and is usually quite shy around new people, 
    Layla is very talkitive and often chats to you when she walks around the house, 
    esspecally at 3am. I'm Laylas favorite person, at night she jumps on my bed 
    and lays by my feet or head and purrs, insisting I pat her, but she gets very 
    annoyed with too many pats and will leave if she recives more than she wants.
