        The Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds. 
        Fully-grown females weigh from 3.6kg to 6.8kg. 
        Males are substantially larger, ranging from 5.4kg to 9.1kg or more. 
        It can take up to four years for a Ragdoll to reach mature size. 
        They have a sturdy body, bulky frame, and proportionate legs. 
        <br>
        Their heads are broad with a flat top and wide space between the ears. 
        They have long, muscular bodies with broad chests and short necks. 
        Their tails are bushy and long in length, their paws are large, round, and tufted, 
        and their coats are silky, dense, and medium to long length. 
        <br>
        Due to their coats tending to be long, they usually require brushing at least twice a week.
        The breed is often known for its large round deep blue eyes, 
        though other cats may have that feature as well. 
        <br>
        The genes for point coloration are also responsible for these distinctive blue eyes. 
        More intense shades of blue are favored in cat shows.
        <br>
        One study, utilizing Swedish insurance data, showed that of the common cat breeds, 
        the Ragdoll and Siamese have the lowest survival rate. 
        With 78% odds of survival to 10 years. 
        An English study of patient records found a life expectancy of 10.1 years. 
        <br>
        The Ragdoll has been known to have a very floppy and calm nature, with claims that 
        these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds. 
        Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation or 
        merely an instinctive reaction from being picked up as kittens by their mother.
