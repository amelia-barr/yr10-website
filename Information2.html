        The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in 
        Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. 
        Miniature Schnauzers may have been developed from the smallest specimens of the 
        Standard Schnauzer, or crosses between the standard and one or more smaller breeds 
        such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Pinscher, and Poodles, as farmers bred a small dog 
        that was an efficient ratting dog. 
        <br>
        They are described as "spunky" but aloof dogs, 
        with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. 
        Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in four colors internationally: solid black, 
        black and silver, salt and pepper, and white.
        <br>
        Miniature Schnauzers have a very square-shaped build, 
        measuring 28 to 36 cm tall and weighing 4.5kg to 6.8kg
        for females and 5.0kg to 8.2kg for males. 
        They have a double coat, with wiry exterior fur and a soft undercoat. 
        In show trim, the coat is kept short on the body, but the fur on the ears,
        legs, belly, and face is retained. Recognized coat colors are black, pepper and salt, 
        black and silver, and pure white; pepper and salt coloration is where coat
        hairs have banded shades of black, gray and silver, fading to a gray or silver 
        at the eyebrows, whiskers, underbody and legs.
        <br>
        The American Kennel Club breed standard describes temperament as 
        "alert and spirited, yet obedient to command,
        friendly, intelligent and willing to please, 
        never overaggressive or timid". 
        Usually easy to train, they tend to be excellent watchdogs with a good 
        territorial instinct, but more inclined toward barking than biting. 
        They are often aloof with strangers until the owners of the home welcome the guest, 
        upon which they are typically very friendly to them.
